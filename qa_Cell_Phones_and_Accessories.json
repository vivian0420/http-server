{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': '9966685472', 'answerTime': 'Jul 5, 2013', 'unixTime': 1373007600, 'question': 'I experienced all that you said with the Samsung Adapter. The Samsung in Texas said it is "GUARANTEED ONLY ON SAMSUNG TV\'s, cables &amp; power adapters?', 'answer': "I am not sure how to answer that because I am not sure if you even really asked a question. You have a question mark at the end, but it seems like more of a statement or an assertion. Are you asking me or telling me? And even if you are asking me a question about what Samsung told you, I don't know what I can tell you regarding a conversation I was not a part of. Here is what I can tell you. I have another MHL adapter purchased from a different vendor and it works perfectly on all of my HD televisions, and none of those televisions are made by Samsung. So it should work on any television regardless of the manufacturer. This is for wired mirroring with the MHL adapter. There is also wireless mirroring. This is different. Wireless mirroring is what requires a change to the settings in your phone. I know that this type of mirroring, at this point in time, does only work with Samsung brand televisions or with the use of a peripheral Samsung brand dongle. So perhaps the person you spoke with was just confused as to what you were actually trying to do and gave you advice about wireless mirroring instead of wired. As for the cables needing to be made by Samsung, that is just a joke. No matter what the brand is, all HDMI cables of the same rating are built the same. There is no proprietary technology in them. They are just an inert conduit to transfer a signal. The biggest difference between HDMI cables is what they use for shielding, and that just impacts signal clarity and will not cause incompatibility. As for the power adapter, there are plenty of technical tutorials that say you do not have to have a Samsung brand power supply. I believe Samsung's own literature that came with the MHL adapter also stated that third-party power supplies can be used. Now the power supply does have to be of a specific power rating. Samsung GS4 power supplies are the correct power rating. (As one would expect.) But I believe the manual itself says you can use other power supplies. (It is hard to remember since I read from so many sources.) So at least some of what that representative told you just seems silly and does not make sense. And that does not give me much confidence in the rest of what they told you. Whenever I get strange answers I just call back, get a different person, and ask again. Don't be surprised if you get a different answer. At the very least though, if your MHL adapter does not work then just return it to whoever you bought it from and avoid dealing with Samsung all together."}

I use Wilson's mobile signal booster with it and it does a great job. The magnet is super strong. I would recommend placing it on the vehicle and leaving it. I moved mine back and forth between two vehicles and I noticed that the adhesive on the bottom that holds the magnet to the antenna loosened just a bit, but not separating. It comes with plenty of cable to place it in the center of a vehicle roof or trunk lid. It's worth the money getting the whole package. If you can get 1 bar on your cell, it will boost it to at least 3 bars. ( that's my experience) Hope this helps. side note: be sure you get the right booster for your particular carrier ( AT&Platinum, Verizon, Sprint...etc)"}

I haven't tried this with an actual bobblehead, but it did keep a vinylmation character upright on the center console of my car in a quick spin around the neighborhood. As Daniel answered, it's all about the roll center and how wildly you drive. Also, note that it's very sticky when clean, and it gets less sticky until you clean it again. I clean mine a few times a year, but I pick my cell phone off it several times per day. If you just stuck your bobblehead down and left it their, you'd have a more sticky solution. I'm sure you can find a 3M command adhesive solution that gives you a lot more stickiness, and still have it be non-marring. It is impressive that when you peal off this Sticky Pad to clean it, even though it's really stuck to the car it comes off without leaving any mark. Wash it with just water, and it's sticky on both sides and ready to go again."}

For me, the most important part of the post he mentioned was the link he supplied: http://marcofrom.com/bb/Stowaway.jad Copy that in your blackberry browser (use "select mode" after hitting menu button), use the go to command, and paste it in. This will allow you to download the Stowaway.jad file which is supplied by the thinkoutside website, but cannot be downloaded there by some error on their part (I kept getting a message saying unsupported file type:text). Thankfully, Marco took it upon himself to provide the file as well, and his link worked perfectly for me. Beyond that, follow the directions, when the Stowaway application asks to change permissions, follow the link and then click the menu button and select save. The numeric passcode has to be entered on the blackberry, then by holding the blue Fn key on the keyboard and pressing the number buttons, followed by pressing the enter key. That\'s all it took for my keyboard to work, as evidenced by this post. All of these details can be found in the main blackberry post as mentioned by Marco along with various other troubleshooting schemes, but hopefully his link (supplied above) is all that is needed. Thanks again, Marco. Ps. Teddy is also correct - thinkoutside ought to supply a minibottle of goo-gone with this thing.'}

EMF is how cell phones WORK. They emit a signal to cell towers made of electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) This is how ALL RADIOS, TVs, SATELLITES, CORDLESS PHONES, function. So if these so called "EMF Neutralizers" actually worked, then your cell phone could not make or receive calls. Luckily these "EMF Neutralizers" DO NOTHING AT ALL or there would be a lot of suckers out there wondering why their cell phones stopped working. LIGHT is EMF at a very high frequency. Unless you want to live underground like a mole, there is no way to escape EMF, nor is there any reason to do so.

{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': 'B0009B0IX4', 'answerTime': 'Apr 21, 2008', 'unixTime': 1208761200, 'question': "How does Plantronics Voyager 510 compare to Jawbone? The only one I haven't tested so far and had a great review on CNET is Jawbone, but I am a little skeptical of CNET's reviews so does anybody have both and if so can you please compare them?", 'answer': 'Hey DrZ, I\'ll tell you about my experience, having owned both headsets. I was very pleased with the Voyager 510; the only complaints I have are that my girlfriend hated the way it looked, the stupid flashing light is totally unnecessary, and after a year or so of using it, it died. What bothered me most was that it didn\'t just konk out one day and stop working, it gradually started experiencing problems whereby the person on the other end would have trouble hearing me from time to time. I believe the reason for this is simply that the swiveling earpiece (that allows it to attach to both ears) got overused somehow since the rubber/plastic near that part actually began to deteriorate. I\'m guessing that was from rotating it to fit into my pocket, since I never wore it on any ear but my left. As for the Jawbone, my experience was generally pretty awful. If you admire the 510 as a workhorse, then the Jawbone couldn\'t be further from what you\'d want. It\'s mind boggling the number of things that went wrong with it within the first month or two of use. First, the charger "port" that connects to the device is WAY too tight, and no matter how gently I tried to remove it, it would pull too hard on the end of the headset, which happens to also be a separate piece that is probably attached during assembly, so frequently pulling on it causes that piece to tear off, exposing electronics. I glued it back on. The first time you put in one of the earclip pieces (which are removable), it requires a TON of pressure to get in, and it is extremely difficult to do without crushing the device in your hand. Within days, the earclip broke off in my pocket; it is incredibly delicate. I replaced it with the other left-ear earclip in the package, but that didn\'t fit as well for me. Within days, it also broke, and I never even put it in my pocket. I bought a bunch of replacements, but while I waited for them to arrive, I decided to buy a Jabra eargel to try, since the earclip method never fit well on my ear anyway (the clip is "springy" and actually resists placement in your ear, causing it to pop out constantly). The Jabra eargel with no earclip fit much better, but I had to Krazy Glue it on. That finally worked, but looked terrible. Then, within a few more weeks, I plugged it in one day to charge and the charging light never came on. It just broke. To be fair to Jawbone, I called their tech support and they gave me an RMA right away with instructions on how to return it for a replacement. I\'m awaiting my new Jawbone right now, but here I am on Amazon checking out the Voyager 510 page, so you can draw your own conclusions from that. As to the sound quality of the Jawbone, I have to give them credit for that, although in wind it is awful; much worse than the 510, since the Plantronics has that built-in windsock thingy. I\'m looking into the new Jabra BT500 to maybe give that a shot, but if I\'m not happy with it, there\'s no doubt in my mind I\'ll be back here to pick up another Voyager 510. Hope I was able to help. ChrisPowers'}

I don't think you could go wrong with either one. But if I had to choose between the two again, I'd still choose the 510 over the 520, but just barely.

So your pretty much taking a shot in the dark when you decide to try this. If I were you I would call your provider and ask them if you can do this with your phone, and I have a copy of the Motorola phone tools software that won\'t work for me because of the way Verizon has programmed my phone {as I stated above} so if you wan\'t it I could probably send it to you (No charge) because its not doing me any good and it could very possibly work for you.

Cars sold in US and other parts of the world need an additional harness, that adapts the ISO harness to a specific car's radio system (see http://www.quickconnectproducts.com/Find/support.php for more info). For example, you can buy Parrot Car Kit FORD Plug and Play Harness or Metra BT-1721-A Aftermarket Bluetooth Integration Harness for Honda/Acura 1998 and Up harnesses for a Ford or Honda. With a harness, you won't need to cut any wiring - it's plug and play - but it would be impossible to include a harness in the box for every kind of car out there. Word of caution: make sure you can successfully pair your phone before permanently installing this bluetooth kit. So far, I've only been able to use a Nokia phone - Sony Ericsson and Samsung phones refused to pair with my kit."}

So if I'm not misinterpreting this: if you cancel before 181 days then t-mobile will charge you a cancelation fee and amazon.com will expect you to pay back the discount on the blackberry you recieved, or if you cancel after 181 days but before the 2 years are up t-mobile will charge you a cancelation fee but amazon.com won't expect you to pay back the discount.

I don't know if CDMA Blackberrys work in China or not. My Verizon CDMA does work through China Unicom's network in larger cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. I have not tried it anywhere else... 2) Before you depart for China, make sure you call customer care and sign up for Blackberry International Roaming. It is 19.99 per month. You can cancel the service once you get home. 3) In order to read Chinese, you need to download Chinese fonts. American service providers do not have that.

I have had this phone for about 5 days now and it seems that the battery life is HORRIBLE?', 'answer': "There is a technical reason for this. In the US, the Q is only available for CDMA networks (e.g. Verizon Wireless) today - specifically for a newer, faster type of CDMA network, known as EV-DO. EV-DO is a power hog [Brief layman's explanation: A wireless cell tower is like a person standing in a crowded room at a party full of international guests. Some people (wireless users) are close - others are further away. Some speak in a language you understand, others do not. Now, imagine you are the person/cell tower and you need to listen to everyone at once. The first thing you need to do is equalize the volume so that everyone is at the same level. This - in a wireless network - is a shared responsibility. The tower can listen more carefully for those users who are further away -- AND the phone can talk louder to enhance it's ability for being heard. With me so far?] My guess is that if you are experiencing poor battery life you are probably at the edge of EV-DO coverage and you phone is shouting to be heard. It can only get better as coverage improves. I have had a Q for 3 months. At home the battery life sucks (&lt; 24 hours) - when I travel, it improves as I tend to go to larger cities with better coverage. Stick with it and VzW EV-DO coverage will improve -- or move. Just my two cents. Feel free to disagree."}

This guide also works for the Jabra BT125 that comes with the Warhawk package for the PS3. This guide will work if you have a fully charged headset and are sure the headset is in perfect condition. Also it is recommended that you have the latest PS3 Firmware which can be found and downloaded under settings&gt;&gt;network update. I wrote this guide while my PS3 was in firmware version 2.01 . I personally believe that these 2 headsets are the best Bluetooth ones for the PS3 system, however between the two, I choose to use my Jabra more often. It stays connected better and it will pair without fail. Sometimes the Motorola one has had trouble but I had no idea what the cause of it was. If you are using this as a buying guide I suggest you get the Jabra because it has never failed for me.Anyway, on to the instructions: Setup for both of these headsets is the same so the following steps work for both of them: Make sure the headset is fully charged. When you first plug the headset into it\'s charging source the light on it will turn on and stay on. When it is done charging the light will turn off. Now press and hold the call button on the Motorola or the light on the Jabra until the light is solid (not blinking). It is now in pairing mode and must be in this mode if you ever have to reconnect it again. If the light is solid, go to your PS3\'s XMB ( the main menu ). Now scroll over to Settings&gt;&gt;Accessory Settings&gt;&gt;Register Bluetooth Device. Now click register headset. Click yes and then start scanning, make sure the light for your headset is on and still solid. At this point I suggest you put the headset on you ear. Once it has detected the headset you will have to put in the headset\'s pin. The default headset\'s pin is "0000". So if the headset is brand new that\'s what it will be. Once it has registered you should hear a beep and the headset\'s light should now be flashing normally. Now back in your accessory settings go to Audio Device Settings and for both the input and output devices select the headset you want to use. If the headset shows up greyed out either click Connect(Bluetooth) or press the call button(for the Motorola) or the light(for the Jabra) on the headset Once only. With the headset now selected speak and if the sound bars light up that means you\'re good to go. Now just select OK at the bottom and you have successfully connected your bluetooth headset to your ps3.'}

This technology is developed by Qualcomm. While GSM 2.5 Generation, is still widely used by Cingular, T-mobile, European and Asian Market (Except Japan). GSM uses smart chip called SIM card, to store the carrier information. However, if you purchased any Cingular branded phone, they are all locked to Cingular ONLY. You CANNOT use T-mobile or other operators\'s SIM card around the world, though, you can use CINGULAR for roaming oversea, which gives them great profit.... This K790A phone, however, is UNLOCKED, that means you can use any operators as you like as long as they are GSM network. Benefits of unlocked phones: 1. Users are not bonded to any carrier\'s restrictions such as limited mp3 ringtone size to 600KB, and also unnecessary software which takes up memory of the phone. 2. User can fully customize the phone\'s network. 3. Can be used world wide without roaming fees, assumed you go to Canada, Europe or Asia and purchase local "PAY TO GO" SIM card. 4. Able to setup mp3s as ringtones without any size limitation. 5. Able to go to Cingular or T-mobile internet (MEdia Net or T-Zone) 6. No carrier branded logos, more individuality. 7. Please note that VERIZON LOVES to block their Bluetooth communication settings except Headset. That means VERIZON Phones CANNOT use Bluetooth to send and receive pictures, mp3s, and messages you MUST need to either use their wireless service or buy extra accessories (USB Cables for $40) to backup pictures to your PCs which again forcing customers to PAY what they don\'t need to. Cingular, T-mobile or any unlocked phones NEVER DOES THAT! In Fact all SE phones that Cingular recently releases comes with a setup CD and USB cable for you to transfer pictures and mp3s! Of coz, this is always included for unlocked phones! PLEASE SWITCH TO CINGULAR NETWORK and get K790A! Ever since Cingular obtained the extra 850MHz and EDGE (2.75 Generation Hi-Speed Internet), the reception has been going very well and I hardly get drop calls or loss in voice quality. T-mobile on the other hand, seems to lack the 850Mhz and customers get really bad reception in general. Hopefully I could answer any of your concern.'}

Any unlocked GSM phone can be used with any GSM carrier as long as you have a SIM card (that is active) for that carrier. CDMA phones are built specifically for ONE carrier only, so even if you had CDMA (say Verizon) and wanted to switch to another CDMA carrier (like MetroPCS), you could not use the same phone for each as they do not have that SIM card you can just switch out and replace. Actually, alot of phone manufacturers will "create" certain models that are all mostly the same except for the fact that some might be carrier specific. Example - the Audiovox 8900, could be 8900m for MetroPCS, and 8900v for Verizon, and maybe a general 8900 that is unlocked (GSM) and then might be used for Cingular and T-Mobile by just "locking it" to either carrier (which could be undone) or sold unlocked to anyone for any GSM carrier in the world that uses it\'s bands -850/900/1800/1900 are the 4 world bands. Some carriers will have more or less features available on their phone model version by what they asked Audiovox to do with it for them.'}

I bought a pair from Best Buy and was paired it with my Treo700w and my Palm T3 with a third party gateway app. It cut out with both. Later, I bought a bluetooth adapater for my PC and it did the same. I returned the S9 to Best Buy and bought a pair of their Insignia BT headphones. It works with all three devices with no cutting out whatsoever. So I thought I got a defective S9. When I saw the bulk pack here for $50, I bought it. I am having similar problems with cutting out (not as bad) but this pair at least controls the media player (prev, next, pause). The first pair didn't. From my experience with these three pairs of wireless headsets, I would say that the S9 has manufacturing problems. If everyone had the same cutting out problems, I'm sure that we'd see more posts than there are, and this product would certainly not have a 4 star rating. If I am still having problems with this pair, I think I'm going to call Motorola and see about getting a replacement pair. If they say that these problems are normal, I'll be returning them.

I can help you with a my experience with an iPhone and the Kindle. Keep in mind this is not scientifically valid, just my personal experience. iPhone uses EDGE network and WiFi. EDGE is ATT\'s network. on a scale of 1 - 10 actually radio buffs use 1-9, but that is another story. The iPhone is barely a 1 anywhere at my house with a lot of breaking up. A sad report indeed. Kindle is a solid 9 anywhere in my location. Kindle uses Whispernet. I am not sure of frequencies are used by cell phones and Kindle. One thing I am sure of, Kindle\'s Whispernet does not have the same coverage across the country as ATT\'s EDGE. Now that can be easily checked by looking at a coverge map for Kindle. I sure wold use Google to bring one up and check to see if you live in Whspernet\'s coverae area. Chaces are, if you are in a metro area you may get reception. I was surprized that some metro areas were not covered by Kindle. I expect if Kindle takes off, I think it will, coverage will grealy expand. I have never missed a single download with my Kindle, I am happy. Another suggestion would be to see if you can find anyone in your area and ask them to come to your location to see the how the reception performs. I love my Kindle.I am going on a cruise next week. I am loading up on a lot of free samples Amazon offers. I intend to read on the balcony of the ship and the beach. Ohhh another thing, the battery does not die. There is a very nice selection of content for a rather new item. Of course I am downloading many mgazines,newspapers, books, blogs and other freebees before I go to Belize, Mexico, Cayman Islands as there will be no Whispernet or EDGE. Ohhhh all is not lost, as you can use your computer and download from the Internet your content to your hard drive. Then xfer from your HD to your Kindle. This is a very simple process. They even give you a USB cable so you can very easily make a xfer to your Kindle. I hope you can use the Kindle.The Internet --&gt; Hardrive --&gt; Kindle methd is quite straight forward.

I can always find the value I am looking for with a maximum of 2 button presses. I don\'t care about the accumulated data memory that the new one has.

Once the device is plugged back in data can be displayed and more data collected. The user entered settings for price per kWh are also retained. The P4400, on the other hand, does not have battery backup and loses all data once it is unplugged.'}
{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': 'B000RGF29Q', 'answerTime': 'Aug 28, 2008', 'unixTime': 1219906800, 'question': 'Electricity Usage Monitor in 220VAC: Does anyone know of an electricity usage monitor that works in 220VAC?', 'answer': 'There is a way that you can use a P4460 to make the measurement. My background is electrical engineering. To make measurements on a 230 VAC load, you modify a standard duplex outlet and build an adapter. Each load on the outlet only sees 115 volts and the KW, KWHr and KVA are double the reading on the P4460. You modify a duplex outlet that is split on the hot leg with the line of one outlet wired from one line to neutral and the other outlet wired from the other line to neutral. An adapter connects from these two outlets to a 230 volt outlet that gets one line current through the P4460 and the other line current direct from the other line. Since the line to neutral voltage is the same for each line and the current read through the P4460 is the same for each line, you double the reading on the P4460 to get the KWHr, KVAHr, KW and KVA for the 230 VAC load. The P4460 is plugged into one outlet (with a short extension cord so you have access to the other outlet) and two cords with plugs. One plug is plugged into one of the split outlets and the P4460 is plugged into the other outlet with the second plug, plugged into the P4460. These two cords are wired to a 230 volt outlet. You feed the split outlet from a 230 volt two pole common trip breaker. I have a 230 volt wire feed arc welder and I didn\'t want to install a 230 volt outlet at each location where I use the arc welder. I removed the jumper in a duplex outlet and wired one outlet to one side of the line and the other outlet to the other side of the line with both neutrals of the outlets wired to neutral and both of the grounds in the outlets connected to ground in the electrical panel. I modified the power cord for the welder to have two 115 volt plugs and to use the welder I plug one plug into one outlet and the other plug into the other outlet. And if I want a longer cord, I use two extension cords. In that way I can have the welder 100\' away from the outlet with two extension cords. If either outlet is used, you get 115 volts so no one can get an unpleasant surprise with this "custom" duplex outlet. Only with two plugs connected to a properly modified duplex outlet do you get a 230 V outlet. If you plug the adapter into a standard duplex outlet, you will have zero volts on the 230 volt outlet. DO NOT try what I did unless you understand what I describe and are capable to do the wiring on you own, or have an electrician modify the duplex outlet and the electrician or you, if you are capable, build the adapter. I don\'t see any risk to my suggestion if competently implemented. It is some trouble to implement but it DOES give a way to check what happens with a 230 volt load! I am running a 230 volt air conditioning unit condenser connected to a walk-in cooler evaporator, and I want to know how many KWHr the set up is using! I am going to try the suggestion for for the walk-in cooler and if anything goes wrong I will delete this post! If you have any questions or comments, call me at 928 567 3417. I accept no responsibility if you implement this suggestion. You may contact me at robenco "at" commspeed.net PeterTR'}

The battery your BB takes could be of a different size or shape than what this charger takes...(so your best bet if always double checking with the seller and making sure before ordering!... It will save ya future grief and aggravation... Also make sure the charger comes with all its parts included, so it's ready to use.

The chip you intend to use must come from a Service Provider that USES any one of these frequencies. If it does, then your phone will operate perfectly well.

How long these last depend on how much you use the sealer, and what setting you use. No company is ever going to warranty consumable items such as these. The unit comes with one spare of each item, and additional heating strips/teflon covers can be purchased separately. I have used similar sealers ( not this exact model, but the picture looks identical to the one I use, except mine has a sliding cutter attachment) to seal mylar bags for long term food storage. They do a good, but not great, job. The seal is a bit thinner in width than is optimal for sealing mylar bags (~ 1/8 " wide, when ~ 1/4 " wide seal is best). I seal twice, slightly offset, to be sure of the seal. The use of oxygen absorbers will create a light vacuum overnight (assuming you press out as much air as you can before sealing), and the presence of this vacuum is a good test of the seal. I get &gt; 95% success in creating a vacuum-tight seal this way, as long as the heating element and teflon foil are in good condition.'}

If true, this model is OLDER *DATA* protocol, not the newer/faster 4G nor 4G LTE, even though it lists CDMA, TDMA, GSM and AMPS. There are newer, just released 4G Wilson electronic models just announced about June, 2014. Go to the OEM website first and look for 3g v 4g (lte). You need to check each device's *DATA* frequency MHz AND transmission mode/protocol (3g, 4g, 4gLTE, CDMA, GSM etc.). Carriers have different frequencies / protocols their systems are designed to support. If all your phones use the same *DATA* frequency, there is a higher likelihood of compliance. As for 'simultaneously' I cannot answer that because some electronics are designed with 2-way simultaneous support (send & receive) whereas others will only do one mode at a time - per device. That is why some of the newer wireless access points are touting 2-way support, they can send/receive simultaneously so more than one device can be served concurrently. Contact Wilson Electronics (OEM MANUFACTURER TECH SUPPORT, not the WILSON retail reseller customer service) for absolute answers. Be aware many of the older Wilson Electronics cellular amplifiers (such as 3g) only boosted *DATA*, NOT *VOICE*. Check the model that is most compliant for your 3 phones as some of the *newer* 4G models are supposed to boost for voice & data. Also, Verizon phones in US I have only been able to get to function within this country using their 4G LTE mode, NOT GSM (which is what AT&T, others might use) even if the phone is dual or tri-band. Unfortunately if you notice there sometimes different product booster model #'s in the past for AT&T vs Verizon because of the above so if your phones are using inconsistent transmission technologies, one mobile booster device may support most but not all of your phones"}

Additionally, the HF3 works better with certain Android phones (the Nexus S and probably the Galaxy Nexus) *as well as* the iPhone. If the controls matter to you, you're better off getting the HF3. Something else that every headphone purchaser should know: Frequency range specs mean nothing. In the first place, they're tweaked and exaggerated. In the second, they're only useful within a single brand to give you a sense of range within it, not between brands with different measuring schemes.

Li-Ion 14500 cells have a nominal voltage of 3.7V (4.2V fresh off charge), while normal "AA" cells are 1.5V for disposables, and 1.2-1.4V for rechargeable types (Ni-Cad/NiMH). Putting 14500 Li-Ion cells into anything designed for "AA" batteries will fry the device instantly. There are also non-rechargeable Lithium "AA" cells, like the Energizer L91, and while those are slightly higher in voltage (1.7V) they usually can be substituted for standard "AA" cells. I would only recommend those in devices that take few cells (1-4). For devices that use a lot of cells (6 or more) the cumulative voltage of the Lithium "AA" cells could be dangerous.'}

Although these are similar air interfaces (the latter is wideband), they do not serve the same purpose. WCDMA is adopted by GSMA (the GSM Association) as a 3G (third generation) carrier technology, and thus used by GSM carriers worldwide (in North America, that's AT&T, T-Mobile USA, and Rogers). CDMA is the standard that's used by the CDMA2000 group for standard 2G voice (and limited data) transmissions. That means mostly in North America by carriers such as Verizon, Sprint (but not NexTel), AllTel, US Cellular, and some smaller regional carriers. Moreover, this standard does not involve the use of SIMs (subscriber identity modules) to identify the user, and thus relies on the phone's serial number for this purpose. In turn, this means that you cannot just go and buy any phone you like and use it - you must register it with your carrier, and so far, that means that it must be one that the carrier has approved beforehand. Sprint (AFAIK) will only approve devices that they have sold directly or indirectly."}

Thus, it is suitable mainly for use with AT&T Wireless in the USA, Rogers in Canada, or Latin American carriers that offer 3G. Also, because the phones use a different firmware images (RM-320 and RM-421 for the N95-2 and N95-4, respectively), the update cycles for each is different. Generally, the N95-2 is better supported by Nokia, with more frequent/newer firmware. The most recent version has an "auto-rotate" feature that uses the internal accelerometer to switch the display orientation between depending on how you are holding the phone - this is still missing in the N95-4 (though you can download third party software such as "RotateMe" from bysamir.fr to get such functionality here as well).

GSM is the "universal" technology used in Europe, Africa and Asia (except Japan, Korea and parts of China), and GSM signals are transmitted over 900MHz and 1800MHz frequencies. In North America things are a bit more messy: There are several different "2G" technologies in use by the various carriers; only a few use GSM at all. Those that do (mainly, AT&T and T-Mobile USA) use different frequencies than the rest of the world: 850MHz and 1900Mhz. Most modern cell phones (GSM-capable phones anyway) support all four of these bands, and are therefore called "quad-band" phones. All Nokia N95s are "quad band", so they can be used nearly everywhere. What makes the N95-2 different from the N95-4 is the frequency it uses for 3G signals (UMTS/HSDPA over W-CDMA). The N95-2 supports the 2100MHz frequency that is used internationally (Europe, Asia, and even Japan), while the N95-4 supports the 850MHz and 1900Mhz frequency used by AT&T Wireless and other North American GSM carriers (except T-Mobile USA) for their 3G networks. Aside from this, the N95-2 is generally better supported by Nokia (i.e. more frequent firmware updates; the most recent update brings a "auto-rotate" feature that is not yet available in the N95-4). In other words, if you are to be using this phone in Europe, there is NO REASON at all to get the North American version (N95-4). If you were considering the non-8GB models (i.e. the N95-1 vs. the N95-3, both of which have smaller screens, silver faceplate, and a SDHC slot rather than built-in memory), THEN there are some additional differences between the international version (N95-1) and the North American one (N95-3). Mainly, the latter is significantly newer, has more runtime memory (RAM), bigger battery, and the camera window is flush with the back of the phone. But again, Nokia supports the international version in a better way, so the firmware available for the N95-1 brings a lot of features not yet available in the N95-3 (screen autorotation, Flash Lite 3 w/flash movie support, "demand paging" for faster loading of applications and less dynamic memory use). Bottom line: In Europe and Asia you should only consider the N95-1 and N95-2. In North America, depending on your carrier and whether you have AT&T or Rogers "3G" coverage, you might choose the N95-3 or N95-4 instead, with the caveats listed above.'}

For those unsure like me what are you going to do or did?', 'answer': 'Hey, I have the n95 8GB (2 years?) -- which is an excellent phone. BUT, I keep running out of room. 8GB is just not enough memory, for me. Pictures, Video, Games & Music. So much stuff on there, and once you use about 6.5GB of space, the phone starts flipping out. There are times when a keyboard would be so useful. It\'s starting to become more of a problem, now that I\'m on facebook, and on the go. As for games, which work well. Java games and Symbian Games, not a problem. But, for emulation, it doesn\'t work well at all. Well... any Nokia with the "ARM" chip, can emulate Nintendo beautifully, but playing it is another story. You can\'t really use the button mapper software to use the media keys as "A" and "B" buttons. Once you press the media keys, it will quickly end your game and bring up the music player -- every single time. Which is great when on the bus, and you want to listen to music, but not so great when you\'re trying to play a gameboy game. No room, no keyboard, no emulation. Nokia n95 8GB is great, but it\'s time to move on. I am waiting for the n97, that\'s my next phone -- and I\'m counting the days.'}

If you connect it directly to the battery then your car does not need to be on. If you plug it into your cars cigarette lighter / auxiliary power port, it will depend on whether your cars power port requires the ignition switch to be in the "accessories" position to proovide power to the power port. The engine itself does not need to be on as the inverter can run directly on battery power. As with any device using power from your car, you will want to prevent it from draining your battery and preventing you from starting your car up when necessary, so I would recommend not using it too long without letting your engine run to recharge the batteries. That being said how long it will run and still , allow you enough power to start your car depends on too many factors, like how high capacity your battery is, how old it is, condition of battery, are other accessories on your car running at the same time etc.... I personally have used it without the car being "on" for 30 minutes.'}

I had the same issue with the iPhone and another device. From BlueAnt Tech Support: "The Supertooth 3 is able to pair up to 8 devices but there is something on the Iphone that makes it differ from other phones. Once the Iphone is paired to any bluetooth device it takes priority. So if you were to switch the Supertooth 3 off of the Iphone and connect it to the other phone then try to re-connect back to the Iphone it would require the Supertooth to be completely re-paired to the device. This is only a issue with the Iphone as it does take priority over any bluetooth device. If you have any other questions or concerns please let me know." It sucks. This is a great device for use with ONE phone. But add another and it goes downhill. You need to re-pair every time and given that it takes a few minutes to pair with this device, as it tries to re-download your address book every time and spends all this time and makes all this noise announcing its progress as it transfers contacts, its becomes a huge annoyance. I have 500 contacts in my iPhone and I am getting sick of hearing all this stuff or even dealing with this re-pairing stuff. As good as the unit is in other respects, this does suck.'}

I doubt that it would work with any other phones as there is a set-up process you must do to "register" the headset to the base cordless phone before it will work (which is explained in the headset user\'s guide). I bought both the cordless phones (set of 3) and this headset as a bundle a few years ago from Walmart for about $120. It was well worth it because they work great together and I would never want to be without this cordless headset. I can talk on the phone all day and still get all my work done (inside or outside).

It is usually AT&T GSM but can be T-Mobile and rarely it can be Verizon. If you want a prepaid that is effortless, Tracfone isn't it. You can try T-Mobile-To-Go. When you accumulate $100 in airtime you automatically become a Gold Rewards member which means, even with the $25 cards, you get 1-year expiration. There is no drawback to this service unless T-Mobile service is not that good in your area. Give it a try.

The AT&T network is automatically listed there and I suppose you can delete it so you wouldn\'t log on by accident. But you can set the phone to "always ask" before logging on.

Better Then the 510?', 'answer': "I dont think so, I had (but lost) 2 510's which were great BT headsets. First off, why did they change the design? The 510 design was unique, while this one just follows along the boom mic trend of many manufacturers. The 510 fit perfectly due to its unique design and because it allowed the earpiece to go in the ear, It would fit and I could hear it perfectly. To that end, the thing came with 3 different sizes and if you chose you could use it without... thats 4 different ways to wear it in one ear. The 520 limits you to a hit or miss earpiece that while better than most, does not give the flexiblity that the 510 had. Voice quality is good... if you are in close proximity to the paired device and if you dont have the 520 in line of sight, you may hear garbling due to sags in reception, this is not a problem I recall with either one of the 510's I had. Looks... gimmicky, faux carbon fiber? kinda large and hangs off the side of your cheek like a wide open barn door. (ok that last one is kinda harsh and not very helpful) I really do find that it does kinda hang there, I prefer my headset to sit close to my cheek, even rest upon it, if it doesnt then it looks and feels strange. So why do I have the 520? well I bought it because I read many great things about it at several websites, and like many people were so awestruck with the performace of the 510 in most aspects that I figured that the 520 which is the upgrade should be far better. However this didnt prove to be the case, I've had it for less than a week, I'll be returning it to get a replacement 510 (for the 3rd time). I dont doubt that this is a good headset from a great company, I dont think they garnered all those positive reviews by chance. But this one is simply not the one for me, hopefully the 530 will be the one. 3/5 stars."}

Truckers often get the Wilson amp, which is NOT cheap, to use with this antenna because they may be in very poor cell reception areas. I\'m actually using this antenna at home. It has what is called a "ground plane"---that\'s the solid lines sticking out horizontally. With a "ground plane", you can place the antenna anywhere---on a car or truck or on a pole at home. Just be sure to keep the antenna away from metal, like the roof. The antenna normally mounts on the external mirror bracket on a truck, which positions it up and away from the roof of the vehicle.'}

Help, anyone?', 'answer': "I have the original Otterbox that I got back when it only came in black and wasn't called the Defender. I absolutely love this case, but am looking for a new one (nothing wrong with the one I have) only b/c I like the color accents (or maybe the white one). The black case can make it hard to find the phone if you lay it down somewhere. I haven't personally seen the Commuter or the Impact, but from reviews of the Commuter case I wouldn't purchase one. It doesn't sound like it offers the same level of protection at all and there seems to be big flaws with fit. I don't know about the Impact. I do know, while Otterbox doesn't list the Defender as waterproof, it certainly is water resistant at the very least. To my great chagrin, I dropped my in the toilet once (clean water thank goodness!). Scared me silly. I rapidly removed the rubber casing. There was a little water on the plastic case, but when I removed the plastic case, the phone was just fine. The only water was a few small drops that I got on it trying to remove the two casings so fast. I wiped those off, dried out the two cases and gratefully put it back on. My only complaint is that the belt/waist band clip doesn't hold the phone as securely as I would want. My husband won't use his clip because in his active job the phone kept popping off the clip when he'd bend over or even just lean to reach something. My problem was mostly getting in and out of the car (sedentary desk job). After scaring myself losing the phone when it popped off in my car (fell in the crack next to the seat, and the black case was very hard to find) and dropping it when I've gotten out of the car, I've acquired the habit of touching it with my hand or elbow automatically in any situation where the phone might pop off. It still pops off now and then, but I haven't lost it mostly because of my habitual vigilance. I love the Defender model. That's why I won't get the commuter even though it comes in more colors (and the color I would really like to have!). But, functionality and protection take priority for me and I'll get one of the two-tone black with color accent. I see you posted your question a while ago. Hope this is still helpful."}

How does the 3G GPS work with the otterbox?', 'answer': "Plastic and rubber typically would not block GPS signals. You may lost a small amount of signal strength, so your fix may be off slightly, but probably not more then a few extra meters. The case is not waterproof (so dont submerge it) however, is significantly water resistant, so if the phone is holstered, and on the outside of your backpack, it should be well protected. The iphone is pretty well sealed to start with, and with the amount of protection this case provides, it should be very safe. I had a defender series on my blackberry curve, and because of the trackball, it had a hole in the center of the skin part, and i've used it in driving rain without any issues."}

Pair the Bluefusion with another (different) phone to see if you can duplicate the problem, if you can, it is likely an issue with the Bluefusion, if you can't, it has something to do with the phone and it's pairing with the Bluefusion, it might need an update on either the phone or/and the Bluefusion.

Also it is very easy to install. I installed in my silverado in approx. 15 mins. The unit I had to plug into was located behind the glove box, and I did not have to pull out the head-unit. The part that took the longest was running the microphone wire, which I ended up putting up towards the top of the left side rail at the top of the windshield.

Help, anyone?', 'answer': "I have the original Otterbox that I got back when it only came in black and wasn't called the Defender. I absolutely love this case, but am looking for a new one (nothing wrong with the one I have) only b/c I like the color accents (or maybe the white one). The black case can make it hard to find the phone if you lay it down somewhere. I haven't personally seen the Commuter or the Impact, but from reviews of the Commuter case I wouldn't purchase one. It doesn't sound like it offers the same level of protection at all and there seems to be big flaws with fit. I don't know about the Impact. I do know, while Otterbox doesn't list the Defender as waterproof, it certainly is water resistant at the very least. To my great chagrin, I dropped my in the toilet once (clean water thank goodness!). Scared me silly. I rapidly removed the rubber casing. There was a little water on the plastic case, but when I removed the plastic case, the phone was just fine. The only water was a few small drops that I got on it trying to remove the two casings so fast. I wiped those off, dried out the two cases and gratefully put it back on. My only complaint is that the belt/waist band clip doesn't hold the phone as securely as I would want. My husband won't use his clip because in his active job the phone kept popping off the clip when he'd bend over or even just lean to reach something. My problem was mostly getting in and out of the car (sedentary desk job). After scaring myself losing the phone when it popped off in my car (fell in the crack next to the seat, and the black case was very hard to find) and dropping it when I've gotten out of the car, I've acquired the habit of touching it with my hand or elbow automatically in any situation where the phone might pop off. It still pops off now and then, but I haven't lost it mostly because of my habitual vigilance. I love the Defender model. That's why I won't get the commuter even though it comes in more colors (and the color I would really like to have!). But, functionality and protection take priority for me and I'll get one of the two-tone black with color accent. I see you posted your question a while ago. Hope this is still helpful."}

You may lost a small amount of signal strength, so your fix may be off slightly, but probably not more then a few extra meters. The case is not waterproof (so dont submerge it) however, is significantly water resistant, so if the phone is holstered, and on the outside of your backpack, it should be well protected. The iphone is pretty well sealed to start with, and with the amount of protection this case provides, it should be very safe.

IM+ crashed on me. The front buttons were a bit squeaky at first but that is almost gone now. The slider feels good. It's a good looking phone. I will say that this phone is being replaced. The earpiece is starting to crap out on me. When I have the phone to my ear if I apply any pressure to the phone to put it against my ear I either can't hear the other person or I can barely hear them. At first I thought it was me not lining it up correctly but that is not the case. I'm not sure if the short is in the ear peace or the slider. I'm just hoping to not have the issue in the new phone. Other than that....The experience with the phone has been great. Oh I will say I also had to get used to the OLED display. It's beautiful and bright indoors but in direct sunlight you almost can't see it. It is the nature of OLED at the moment. I also have an MP3 Player with an OLED display that is the same way."}

The international version work in Brazil ?', 'answer': 'Both the "International" and the "US" version work in Brazil. However, it may or may not work in 3G mode depending where you are and which operator you use (Claro, TIM, Oi, Vivo, CTBC...). To be short, if the operator uses 850 Mhz 3G, you\'ll need the US version. If 2100 Mhz, then you\'ll need the international. Google "frequencias 3g brasil": http://mosquitoeletronico.blog.br/index.php/3g-no-brasil/ To be honest, if you travel a lot and uses, for example, Claro (which uses the two ranges in Brazil), I would consider buying other phone that supports both (850 and 2100). Claro uses 850 in SP but 2100 in MG. Oi/BrT and Vivo use 2100 everywhere, but Vivo also uses 850 in MG (850/2100). I\'ve heard that the major carriers (the big four) will eventually migrate to 2100 Mhz, which is the "International" (a.k.a. European) version, but I\'m not sure yet. But in any case, I don\'t think that the 850 band will go away any time soon, so you will be OK going with 850 **if your operator uses it**. But don\'t count on it, it\'s just my guess.'}

My only problem with it has been getting it to see my Blue Toothed Apple equipment (computer and iPod). 2 other speakers deserve consideration: the Creative D100 ($70) and the Motorola EQ7 (made by JBL). But this Motorola has, in just the past 2 months, risen in price even more than the EQ5 (practically doubling), so I\'d be hesitant to give in to the Motorola asking price.

I really don't now what all that means, but in my opinion I think any Bluetooth phone should work. After I received my iKross device, I just charged it for two and one half hours, turned it out, went to setting on my iPhone and turned on Bluetooth. The connection took all of about 45 seconds. Haven't had any problems since. It has worked well for me and is very simple to use. One thing I did notice when using GPS is that after asking for directions my iPhone comes on and displays the map but audio is also through the iPhone. Phone calls are routed through the iKross. All in all, I'm happy and it works well for me. Considering the price, I can't fault the device. Hope this helps you."}

The unit that you were recommended is a great unit and it will cover voice and data up to 3G. I understand your concern regarding 4G and offer a little more clarification regarding this topic. 4G is usually* Data network therefore even after that network becomes available through AT&T in your area there will always be Voice, SMS and 3G Data. The amplifier that you were recommended covers two ranges of frequencies, 800 MHz and 1900 MHz which covers all your typical US domestic carriers for both Voice and 3G Data but whereas 4G is transmitted on a different frequency it would require a different amplifier for that range specifically."

Any suggestions?', 'answer': 'the jawbone prime is the ONLY headset thus far that has been able to eliminate wind noise. i own the jawbone 2 with noise assasin (tm). before i bought it i did some research to find out what\'s so special about noise assasin. well there\'s a sensor on the earpiece that touches your face. it matches the vibration from your jawbone to the sound in the air using alogorithms. by doing this it can pull your voice into the microphone and block out EVERYTHING else. now of course there are limitations, like very loud music and what not. but normal background noise is non existent. last week i did a test while i was in a basketball gym. i called my voicemail and recorded about 10 seconds with noise assasin on, then turned it off...WOW! all those basketballs dribbling and echoes and the constant "buzz" was COMPLETELY blocked! i was astonished. i had done some tests around my house before, but this was really blew me away, and it was because of the difference with it on & off. oh, by the way it picked up my voice loud and clear. i didn\'t have to speak louder than normal or anything. and if you pull the sensor off of your face your voice will get muffled with the rest of the ambient noise. this lets you know that it is not a gimmick, but an integral part to the noise assasin. i got one phone call while i was in the gym and in the middle of the conversation i turned off the noise assasin and the dude was like what the %$*@ happened?!?! he was talking when i turned it off and he stopped mid sentence because it was such and extreme change. i told him what i had did and he was like wow i gotta get one of those! but they, along with EVERY other bluetooth with noise cancellation, admittedly had no answer for wind noise...until now jawbone prime features noise assasin 2.0. it blocks higher decibal levels and they have figured out how to eliminate wind noise as well as the interference it causes. they use the aforementioned sensor to help out. with wind interference your highs can be heard in the microphone, but your lows are covered. so they use the sensor to "feel" your lows and the microphone to hear your highs, then matches them back together for a seamless sound. now they admit it won\'t work in every situation, and for that it will give you a beeping signal that lets you know that you may not have been heard due to wind interference. so i think with the convertible it can handle street driving, but it may not be able to handle highway driving.'}

Is it direct burial cable?', 'answer': "Casey, The amplifier is indoor-only. I believe all coaxial cable is buryable 1 because it is vinyl jacketed, 2 because it is low voltage, and 3 because you will probably replace it with something newer and better in only 10 or 20 years. Don't bury any connectors. They must be kept dry. I bought the YX510 about 4 years ago and it has never failed or disappointed me. (It might help some that I am an engineer and know what mistakes to avoid.) I have been thinking that it might soon be time to replace it with a unit that gets more frequencies. The key fact is that the unit is a linear amplifier. So the size of the indoor zone depends on how much signal the outdoor antenna collects. An antenna above the trees is essential. My outdoor antenna is high gain, so the indoor zone covers two-thirds of the house, with 5 bars in half the house. This is even though the only tower within sight of my house is 10 miles away. The unit came with 50 feet of RG6. I replaced that with 50 feet of RG11. The indoor antenna connects with a 50-Ohm connector, so I inserted 60 feet of RG8. This 110 feet of ultra-low-loss cable has about the same loss as 50 feet of RG6. If my memory is correct, the total project was: zBoost unit $250 High gain antenna $150 50 feet of RG11 $120 60 feet of RG8 $100 2 adapters: RG8 to zBoost $40 About 3 days of my time $0 Ken"}

Our system uses two different antennas: the fish-bone-like Yagi antenna and the square antenna. We receive both Voice and Data and these are hooked up to the ZBoost amplifier that is inside of the house, which then redistributes the signal to our Verizon cell phones and our computer which uses a Verizon MIFI device to receive the signal for the computer.

If you have 2 to 3 bars then this will theoretically place those inside your home. The second question is how much distance do you want inside the home. If you just went with this and say a small candy bar inside antenna (the piece that amplifies the incoming signal inside your home) then your going to be limited to sitting close to that point to use your phone. They make cradles that attach to the antenna's cable that comes in your house and this cradle will amplify this signal but it's limited to usually leaving the phone in or very near to the cradle to actually work. The best way to increase the signal inside your home is to purchase both the outside antenna and an inside powered booster with it's own inside antenna.

Inc only mentioned a Blackberry and Droid battery so we'll have to wait to see what products the other 5 batteries fit. It sounds like they will eventually do away with battery door replacements and have only replaceable battery/receivers. Of course Apple users will always have to buy an add-on device since they don't have replaceable batteries. Apple users will get internal inductive charging when Apple decides it wants to give it to them - and users will have to buy a new phone to get it. BlackBerry & Droid users can have it as soon as July when PowerMat releases the replacement batteries."}

{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': 'B002OB49SW', 'answerTime': 'Mar 17, 2010', 'unixTime': 1268809200, 'question': 'Comparing to Nexus One, is there any reason to buy N900? Anyone has any idea?', 'answer': "I am carrying both phones with me at the moment. I enjoy using both devices very much. You know maybe it is just the geek in me but somehow I have more fun with the n900. I like having the physical keyboard. People complain about the three row design but it doesn't bother me a bit and with the predictive auto complete I type at a pretty good clip. The screen on the Nexus is brighter and the blacks are darker until you get it outside then it is completely unusable in the sun. Another thing is that although I love the Nexus one screen I am not convinced the colors are as accurate as on the n900. The seem a bit on the over saturated side. Either that or AMOLED is opening up the world of color we never thought was there. I notice the n900 mirrors the color on my MacBook Pro display. Both displays are excellent. For everyday use you have to consider the amount of time you spent in direct sunlight or even driving around where excessive light will hit the screen. The N1 is really hard to use in those conditions. The n900 handles direct sunlight without any issues. I use the av cables and the SNES emulator to output the n900 to my TV for some gaming fun. Pretty sweet if you ask me. Also using the wii remote or the sony six axis controller for all those classic SNES games rocks. Android has SNES emulators also and it works very well on the N1. I don't know maybe I eat more Wheeties then most but to me the weight difference is negligible. Yes the n900 is thicker but the Nexus is Taller and wider. Both phones are well constructed. I use the FM transmitter daily. The range isn't great but it works. Both my cars have a sweet spot that on 89.1 plays impressively clear for what it is. I also have Transmission installed on the n900 and download all types of music while texting, surfing the web or anything else I am doing as it does its thing in the background. Maps kicks ass on the Nexus and OVI blows right now. Sygic has just released their navigation system which looks pretty sweet for Maemo (no US maps yet :() so that should help but you have to buy that which of course is a bummer compared to Google Maps. To me the phone functions are about the same. I can't say that Android phone application is anything special at this moment in time. The n900 isn't either but Skype calling built in pretty much rocks. Google talk integration works on the n900 and you can sync your contacts and calendar but it is nowhere near as elegant as an Android device. Voice quality on the n900 is better and at least in South Florida the n900 always seems to have a much stronger signal hold then then N1. Also testing data speeds the n900 is consistently faster. The n900 multitasking is nicer then Androids as is the Web browser. Flash isn't a big deal since Android will get it soon enough and in the meantime if you really want it a quick trip to XDA-Developers will yield you an HTC Desire Rom that runs Flash. I have watched several videos while running Sense UI on my N1 and it is decent. Not great but its ok. Flash is passible but not great on the n900 either. It works but its just ok. Nice to have though. My only real concern with the n900 is future support and upgrades from Nokia. With the merging of Moblin and Maemo and no real promise there will be a real consumer update (Nokia brass has mentioned they expect a solid development tool for the n900 and with QT software compatibility) but still you know Android will be updated by Google and the Nexus should get lots of upgrades over the next year or two easy. The Android market place is currently far more loaded with apps. Cameras are a somewhat mixed bag on both phones. The can each take a decent picture under the right conditions. I would have to give the nod to the n900 since the N1 blurs with just about any motion making it difficult to shoot a picture of my kids or dogs. The n900can lag a bit at times when you start to load up the apps at one time and have a bunch of widgets on the desktops. The N1 is wicked fast and is overall lag free. I also like the notification system better on Androids OS. It is easy to slide down the blinds whenever you want to see whats going on in a pinch. That's all I can think of right now...getting sleepy but if anyone has any questions for an owner of both devices hit me up I will do my best to fill you in."}

I just want to use it mostly for email and internet. any Ideas ?', 'answer': 'just call tmobile and have them activate the sim. then you just put it in the phone. you dont need to "activate the phone." your tmobile account is all stored in your sim. what phone you use doesnt matter to them and gsm doesnt store any account info in your device. your phone number is in your sim, not the phone. you can use kelly\'s suggestion and just get an internet plan if that\'s all you want. but this phone does not need the smartphone plan. you can get it to work with the $10 internet plan. so you\'re probably better off with the Even More Plus 500 Talk plan. it is basically like prepaid. there\'s no contract. but it\'s a little better because you still get your bill at the end of the month like a regular account. theres no credit check. and it\'s 29.99 + 10 (internet) = 39.99. So for the same price as the internet only service, you can have unlimited internet AND 500 minutes (+ unlimited nights, weekends, and mobile to mobile). For $10 more you can also add unlimited texting. If you get a non-smartphone plan ($10), the only thing you need to change in your phone is: Settings &gt; Internet Connections &gt; Connections &gt; T-Mobile Internet + Edit &gt; Next &gt; Access Point Name: internet2.voicestream.com Leave username and password blank. Make sure the box is unchecked. Click Finish. (Click the blurry area above the other windows to close them out) Hope this helps :)'}

I had the same questions as RY Chua has. Hence did the research and found out the differences. That said, I still bought this phone and love it. I personally can't comment of whether the update on Xpress music has made that screen more sensitive than the current Nav version or not. Although kinetic scrolling is a plus in the new firmware. Apart from that I liked the chrome strip on the Nav compared to the Xpress music, which comes with the same color strip as the rest of the phone (check out the pics of the Nav edition vs. Xpress music). Also, I bought it from a different seller and paid a little extra as amazon didn;t have this price then, so this price is great for the Nav edition."}

I would just continue using it. They will contact you or upgrade your plan if they decide you should be on one of their more expensive tethering plans. Normally, what they look for is a computer tethered to the Internet through the phone and using their Internet servers. If they don\'t see that, I wouldn\'t worry about it. It sounds like you are using a dialup provider number - which only results in per minute call charges. This is like using the old CSD system - and it still works. The Slingbox probably doesn\'t use the amount of data a computer uses (mobile vs standard data streams). Don\'t change your plan unless you have to. Older plans only remain in effect while they are in use. You can\'t return to those cheaper plans, no longer offered, once you upgrade to one of the newer plans offered. One of the great things about the 5800 is you get to use a smartphone without using a more expensive data plan like the iPhone or the Windows phones, and you aren\'t automatically locked into a data plan like you would be if you had purchased a locked "AT&T supported" phone. I\'m doing more with my 5800 Nav than I ever did with my Windows Mobile 6.1 Tilt, and faster - but, I\'m also using a 3.5G signal with the 5800 that my Tilt never saw or used.

Does This Product Work With The Droid Incredible By HTC ?', 'answer': "The product works as described. It picks up the channel well and the sound coming across the car's stereo system is exceptional. My phone (HTC Incredible) fit well with the silicone cover into the holder. Without the phone cover it was a little loose but held with the enclosed pads added to the holder. As others have noted, the power outlet of the vehicle needs to be in the correct position. I have a Ford F150 super crew cab and the dash board angles toward the driver as it comes up so the device leans toward you and is very unstable. Fortunately the slide out ash tray is next to the power outlet so I leaned the device against it and this supports it adequately. Others may have problems with instability in other vehicles. A power outlet down in the car's console would be the best scenario. I accepted calls and the device works well over the car's sound system. The caller had no problems hearing me and I heard him well too. The music automatically paused when I answered the call and picked back up after I ended the call. Very convenient. The phone stays charged well and even picks up a charge as it is being used. I tried this with the navigation running as well as music playing as this seems to use the most power. The phone was fully charged after use. I feel I got my money's worth but only after I had read these reviews and made an informed purchase. Some folks with little or no creativity will not like this product. Fortunately I could have fun at a funeral. Found this in the reviews and another one that had a positive experience with a HTC Incredible."}

The best you can get on TMobile in the U.S. is 2.5G. Still better than Edge. I\'m not sure there is a European version (or more correctly, a US version since the Euro version came out first). The only difference would be the tuner frequency timing of the FM radio. And the warranty as you pointed out E.S. edited to add: I went back to Nokia\'s specs page and it looks like the mini includes both Euro & NAM FM timings.

{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': 'B002WRKZZ4', 'answerTime': 'Nov 4, 2013', 'unixTime': 1383552000, 'question': 'How many volts, watts and mAh is this unit and is there a storage battery?', 'answer': 'I have a similar hand crank charger / flashlight. Internally, mine has an alternator with a rotating permanent magnet inside a stationary field that has several poles and coils. The coils are interconnected with a group of silicon diodes to convert the AC output from the coils into pulsing DC. The output from the diodes is wired to a coin style rechargeable lithium battery. I think the battery is about 3 volts. The "charger" output on mine is a coaxial plug with a switch that disconnects one of the battery terminals, and allows the output of the alternator and rectifier array to charge an external battery. My guess is the voltage and current are both variable, but the diodes prevent any reverse current flow, and the output of the alternator without a load is in the region of 8 to 12 volts, but with a load the output drops to a little above the battery terminal voltage. The current is limited by several factors: the strength of the permanent magnet, the force you apply to the crank, and the load resistance. My cell phone has a charging regulator inside the phone, so I just turn the crank until I feel some resistance to my cranking. At that moment, my phone\'s LCD shows an animation that it is charging. After several (10 to 15) minutes of steady cranking, the crank suddenly becomes a lot easier to turn, and the LCD on the phone shows the phone is fully charged. My phone\'s wall charger says its output is 5.3 volts at 500 ma, so I would put the output of the crank charger in the same ballpark. You probably want to make sure you are using your charger with a battery powered device because the raw output of the alternator and rectifiers is unfiltered, unregulated, but full wave rectified AC. Pulsing DC like that is fine for battery charging, but not usable for powering a device without a filter capacitor and possibly some sort of crude regulator as a replacement for a battery. A battery connected to this charger will behave a bit like a filter capacitor and a crude regulator, smoothing out most of the AC ripple present in the output of the hand cranked alternator / rectifier. I think the battery inside my hand cranked charger / flashlight lasts 10 or 15 minutes, at probably 100 ma before the LEDs become too dim. So my guess is this unmarked battery has a capacity of 200 or 300 MaH at 3 volts.'}

Adding more TracFone Airtime cards extends your active service 30, 90, or 365 days from the date the card is added, depending on the denomination of the Airtime card.

When you buy a TRACFONE, some will double your minutes and some will triple the minutes that you buy. You never lose any service time or the minutes you buy. You have to watch at the end of the year and buy another card "before" your year of service runs out. You will keep your minutes. If you were to have to buy another phone for some reason, all of you minutes and time will roll over to the new phone. Now, if you want to have a better camera, "more mega pixels", you will have to buy one of the more expensive cameras. You will have invested $100 +- for the service and minutes plus whatever you spend on the phone. For one year that\'s all you will spend.

And the lock is meant to ensure that the phone can't be used on any other operator's network until a different software code is entered to unlock the device. Carrier locks come with just about any cell phone you buy from a wireless operator. Even if you aren't buying the device directly from a particular operator but are buying it from a retailer, such as Amazon or Best Buy, and it's for a specific carrier, then most likely it has a carrier lock on it. This is regardless of whether you buy the phone with a subsidy and a two-year contract or if you buy the device at full price. An UNlocked cell phone means it can be used with any provider. You have to go to a provider and purchase a card for the phone so it will be on the Verizon or AT&T or whatever service."}

If you want to use the manufacturers warranty, you will call 1-888-987-4357 to speak with Samsung and request an RMA and loosely see if it seems covered by warranty terms. If it seems so, they will ask you for your email or home address and send you both the RMA number (return authorization) and a prepaid UPS label. You will pack the phone (if it is the phone for sure, you will not include the battery) and bring it to UPS / UPS authorized shipping centers and drop it off for shipping. The adressee will be their Samsung technicians in Plano, TX if in the USA. The techs will receive and test the phone carefully seeing you didn't cause the damage by water, dropping, etc., and to further verify it is in fact their fault. If it is, they will repair it and send it back to you at no cost to you. If they determine it is your fault, even partially (such as you get humidity in your phone-your fault- plus it had a defective display beforehand-their fault), then they will email you the fees and a way to pay. You will need to pay, if your are on the hook, at least all the postage and probably diagnosos too even if you decide it is not worth repairing, so if it is anything but a clear cut case of defect, you will learn it simply isn't worth returning and probably forget about it (and they won't return it without postage). There is usually a (strict!) 30 day no questions asked requirement by law that the phone can be returned in the original unused condition to the original seller. Personal experience if it isn't T-Mobile or Amazon.com sold and shipped directly (not marketplace sellers, but rather *direct from Amazon.com*), it is a situation you want to not bother and chock up to learning as third parties can make this process miserable with their red tape and sometimes impossible demands."}

I just tried it at home and heard a sound when I connected the pop phone to the BlackBerry, so I knew it was recognized. When I looked at the screen, I saw "headphone" on the lower left and tapped on that and it turned on the pop phone! The sound is loud and clear -- really a little too loud, even at the phone\'s lowest setting. I may try another one to see whether it\'s just this pop phone\'s mic. It seems that "headphone" has to be tapped and activated on the phone\'s screen for each phone call after the pop phone and BlackBerry are connected.

Also, the bottom brackets slide in or out (up to the size of the unit) to adjust to the width of the phone. When the side grips are at their widest setting (no tension) you simply put your phone in the unit, and press the sides together to create the new tension on the size of your phone. We have used this unit with various cell phones from different family members. The adjustable tension side grips and slide bottom are also great for keeping the cord connected for charging purposes - never really in the way; and if they are, you simple adjust the unit and your phone (flip the unit upside down or sideways) to accomodate.

I have never been to cuba but I had the same concerns as you when traveling to Europe a few times. I took a look at the cell phone bands for cuba and they use band GSM 900. The Samsung E1080 is compatible with both the 900/1800MHz GSM bands. Based on that problem I really don't think you would have a problem and I highly recommend this phone. Why do I like this phone? -- The phone is simple but more importantly the battery life lasts for several days without charging. I also like the alarm feature which is about the only thing I want it a basic phone for traveling. Texting also works fine but that is to be expected. I also took a Droid 2 global for my wife while traveling. That phone works great since it is fairly cheap now and you can connect to wifi access at coffee shops, bars or anyplace that has an open wifi connection. For traveling though, I would prefer the Samsung E1080 purely because I am more concerned with having a long lasting battery when traveling in a foreign country. I hope this helps. :) Cheers, Phil"}

{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': 'B003JP7GN2', 'answerTime': 'Feb 20, 2013', 'unixTime': 1361347200, 'question': 'how many mAh is this?', 'answer': "I know what you want to know, but your question has a slight error. You want to know how many mA (milli-Amps) this device puts out- not how many mAh (milli-Amp-hours). From the product description: Dual USB Charging Ports: Provides 1.0 amp of current when charging one device, and 0.5 amps of current to each port when charging two devices from AC or DC power. For AA or 9V charging, single port charging is supported. DC 5V +/- 5% 1000mA MAX So if your device is capable of absorbing 1000 mA (1 A), and you leave it connected for 1 hour, you would deliver 1000 mAh. Two hours, 2000 mAh, three hours, 3000 mAh, and so on. It's perhaps a fine distinction but it is important. HOWEVER- I think you may be disappointed if you try to use this as your primary charger for a device that requires 2100 mA of charging current (note I did not include the 'h'). It will only deliver 1A maximum, so if your Galaxy Tab will even charge from this device, it will take approximately twice as long as it would to charge from the Galaxy Tab's original AC adapter.

My living room is about 400sqf. But usable coverage extends to an area roughly 1000sqf for me. But honestly I think if I mounted higher it would be more coverage. The signal from inside antenna roughly is cone shaped coming from it. So again the better your outside signal and the higher you mount inside antenna the more you would get. I think mine would probably cover 2500sqf if mounted upstairs in my house. But where I have in living room signal actually goes upstairs. And once I'm outside I have coverage anyways."}

Normally the antenna will attach to an amplifier from Wilson. One goes outside and the other antenna goes inside. The problem you may find if you are using it for internet connection is the frequency of your provider. Verizon 4G LTE is in the upper 700Mhz range while normal phones are 900-1800 range and this antenna is not suited for 700. The joy of different connectors for no good reason will cause a few problems. Verizon makes a router with outdoor antenna that works pretty well but again different connectors, (SMA).

For instantance, I rock mine in and out of place to use a snug fig around my iPhone5s but there are wider ones. I can't say how wide it goes but it looks like it would possibly fit. The main concern you would have is the proximity to the pad you rest on to your phones antenna. Most of the loss comes from this being a proximity antenna and not directly connected to an antenna port. If you want my 2 cents. Go to someone like TelcoAntennas and search out your model for the antenna patch cable and you can buy on amazon the antenna patch cable and window or magnetic mount antenna. There are even magnetic mounts that guide you antenna in from your trunk and into your vehicle to where you connect to your phone. Just remember this is a signal booster but not very much gain will be noticed unless you closely match up your antenna (and your phone is wide and probably along the outside rim) to the amplification point on the cradle. It's not for everyone. But heck, you can always buy and try, right?"}

How many amps is this product rated for? Is there anything I can do to fix it?', 'answer': "I am wondering if you were overloading the circuitry. If you have a powerful radio or premium sound system, it can draw significant power, so if you were using more than the USB charger functionality, the 110v socket, you have to do the math. 150W is the rating. If the car was running, you charge at about 13.8V, and watts equal volts times amps, W=V*I so amps = watts divided by volts. Amps = 150/13.8 = 10.9 amps. If the vehicle was not running, then the amperage changes because the input voltage changes. This would be 150/12.4 = 12.1 amps. Of course this is at maximum load. If you add the all of the cigarette accessories together, you're allowed 15 amps. This leaves only 3.9 amps for your radio and any other loads that may be on the cigarette lighter, such as other phone chargers, gps, mp3 player, etc. I was able to use this inverter to run a crockpot on low through an extension cord to the back seat floor, while using a GPS and playing the radio at a moderate volume in a Ford Explorer without any fuses being blown. I suggest trying it by itself and powering only ONE device through the 110V socket that operates at a maximum of 150 watts. Devices with electric motors such as fans and compressors can draw double the current (therefore watts) when it starts up and this is called Peak power consumption. Try it with something without a motor if possible."}

The one provided by Seidio at the link above for 29.00 doesn\'t actually get you anything but a back cover that you already get for the battery. No clip for your belt, no way to car mount it, nothing.....I have called Seidio and they said that they have NO plans for a holster or car mount so the only way you have to carry the phone is in your pocket/purse. For those looking for a quick release belt holster so you can easily transition it from belt, to ear, to car dash mount the only thing I found is the one for the Casio G\'zOne Brigade that is at the Verizon store and you can also get online. If you aren\'t sure go into a Verizon store yourself with your 3500 battery powered incredible and see for yourself at how good of a fit it makes. It isn\'t a "pouch" style so you can see it at a glance and clip it on your dash. I\'d post a link to it at the verizon store, but I\'m not sure amazon would like that so here is the verizon model number and you can look it up yourself...Part#: VZW741HOL. I also just found what I THINK is the same holster on amazon for dirt cheap... Rubberized Force Holster for Casio Brigade G\'zOne (Black) The only suggestion I would make for you on it is to soak the holster in boiling water to soften the plastic a bit. Then put your phone in the holster and let the plastic cool and form around the incredible. You would swear that this holster was made for the extended battery and since Seidio (who I love as a battery maker, but REALLY dropped the ball on this one) doesn\'t make a case I don\'t feel guilty offering other ideas.'}

I placed the antenna on a mast 25 feet up above the base unit. I have a full 4 bars inside my travel trailer and can use my AT&T iPhone 4 without any issue. This includes 4G data (note - not 4G LTE data, just 4G data). This is good enough to stream video from VuDu and Hulu streaming services, though Netflix has difficulty at times with connecting. Note: the trick is to get the external antenna as high as possible and the more directly above the base unit the better. Also, the transmission inside is not over a great distance. For instance, my travel trailer is 32 feet long. With the base unit in the center of the trailer, I lose 1 bar at the front and back of the trailer so the signal doesn't travel that far from the base unit. Still usable but just a loss of one bar. Outside of the trailer I get nothing. This is to be expected since my travel trailer has metal siding. I'm very pleased with the unit and how it works. It is a little light weight, especially the antenna so treat it with care and you should do fine with your situation. The good thing is Amazon's return policy if it doesn't work for you. Just get that external antenna up as high as you can and as far away vertically from the base as you can. That seems to be where most people are running into problems with the zBoost."}

In the system used in urban areas they use "band 4" which uses 1700 & 2100 mHz simultaneously. In more rural areas they plan to install a "band 17" 700-mHz system which has better "reach".

If you are connected, but have a weak, or no cell phone reception, then you should have a MicroCell. They are generally put in a window to get a clear shot to the sky, but if you don't have open space for the MicroCell to see satellites, it doesn't help you much. Get this antenna, and put it where it has the largest unobstructed view of the sky. Connect it to your MicroCell. It will connect with the satellites and and give you amazing connection. I had 0-1 bars, with the MicroCell, before I got the antenna. Now, I have 5 continuous bars. You will get signal degradation if the satellites are out of orbit to connect you, so you may get signal disruption for 30-60 minutes (randomly)/day. Definitely worth it to get the antenna"}

Will this work?', 'answerType': '?', 'answer': "There are several factors you have to consider. First, this little converter can only provide 500mA of output current. If your Galaxy S4 expects to draw around 1A then this is not going to work. Second, the total energy packed in two AA cells (assuming you're using two 2000mAh NiMH cells) is only 5Wh. After conversion loss, this is only enough to boost your phone's internal 3.7V lithium battery by about 1000mAh. So you'll need at least two sets of 2x AA cells just to charge your phone once. It is better to look for a more powerful backup battery pack (with at least 1A output current and capacity of 3000mAh) for your journey. For example, consider Opteka BP-SC4000 Ultra Thin Solar Powered High Capacity Backup Battery and Charger"}

For your case, just call them up and tell them to disable any data going to your phone, because from experience, smart phones try to get data even when you're outside your wifi.

To hard reset your N8 you should turn it off. Hold down the Volume Down + Camera + Menu buttons and press the power button until the phone vibrates. This will wipe the phone's memory and all settings, turning it back to factory settings. Please keep in mind that this will result in the total loss of any content you have stored on the phone so please backup your phone's files using Nokia Suite before you do this. 2. You should be able to re-install the firmware from the Nokia Suite desktop software. Connect your phone to your computer and start up Nokia Suite. Look under Software Updates and it should show you the current firmware version of your phone. There should be a link that will allow you to re-install your current firmware. Re-installing the firmware should not cause you to lose your data or settings, but I would still recommend backing up your files. Personally, I would probably go with the firmware option and see if that helps. But if it doesn't then you may want to speak with Nokia Care and see if they can do something. FYI - their only repair facility in the US is in Texas."}

Or how to differentiate between the monthly plan vs pay as you go SIM cards? Thanks.', 'answer': "When you buy this phone brand new it already comes with a SIM card in it. All you need to do is activate it. You can do that online or with a landline phone. There will be instructions with the literature that comes with the phone. Monthly plan and pay as you go, as you refer to, has nothing to do with the SIM card. Once you've activated the phone and have your new phone number with this phone you can either go online at the Net10 website to purchase your minutes or plans, or you can go to stores like pharmacies, grocery stores, walmart, radioshack, etc. to also buy these cards for minutes or plans. A Net10 minutes card or plan card is not the same as a SIM card. A SIM card is a tiny computer chip-like object inside the phone near the battery when you take off the back cover you can see this. A Net10 minute card or plan card from the store is a plastic card the size and shape of a drivers license and has a number code on the back that has a scratch off surface that you scratch with a penny to see the number code and there are directions on the card to tell you how to use it and add it to your phone. If you go online to buy minutes or plans it costs just the same as if you were to buy a Net10 card at the store, plus its easy to do from home and once you confirm your purchase online the minutes arrive on your phone instantaneously. I buy the 600 minutes for 45 dollars every two to three months and I don't buy plans because I don't use my phone all the time like a teenager lol The Net10 Samsung T401G is a great basic phone with camera and keyboard, plus you can't beat the price on"}

Go to a store which sells this phone (Target, WalMart, KMart, Albertson's, Walgreens, CVS,etc.) and look for the rack with 'refill cards'...usually at a price of $20 for 200 minutes plus a month of activation, and more money for cards with more minutes and activation time. Or, you can call Net10 directly and sign up for direct withdrawal from your credit card--which gives you 200 minutes (10 cents per minute incoming and outgoing or 2 1/2 cents per text message incoming or outgoing) and one month activation for only $15 a month plus your state's sales tax. Net-10 seems to be phasing out these pay-by-the-minute cards in favor of much more expensive cards used for their new line of smart phones. If you don't have their customer service number, it can easily be found via their website...and I have always found them very responsive and willing to help...but they only work via your credit card. I have had my T401G phone for years and love it."}

I had their cheapest data package (which at the time was cheaper than a 3g/4g package) so I was able to roam around outside of WiFi range and use AT&T data network, but they shouldn't force you, but things might have changed. If you don't have a package, then AT&T will charge you by the KB. In this whole cellphone game, there really is no winning. But, to answer your question, if things have not changed, then this phone will NOT automatically trigger AT&T to attach a data plan to your account."}

Thank you.', 'answer': 'There are accessories available on Amazon, such as a universal dash mount that are built specifically for mounting purposes. That could be mounted on the visor. As well, a plastic or leather phone holder that is built to hold the phone on the pants belt can be used to clip it to the visor, particularly one that has a double belt clip for stability. Ultimately, when I need to make a call on the road, I find a place to park and use the phone safely. I also never call from inside of the vehicle, due to the fact that it is said that using the cell phone in small spaces augments the amount of radio-frequency radiation that is emitted from cell phones. Also, poorly charged phones send large pulses of radiation, so keeping the phone well charged is a safety issue.

Texting is just fine too, no issues. There is only one that I'm aware if that comes with a clip, the ones we only buy, the Defender. Clips over your belt or pants, great for running. There are 2 down falls of Otter Box in my opinion. 1. You have to be careful when cleaning face of case, I take completely off phone, wash with warm soapy water (dish washing liquid) as it gets mucky with finger prints and skin oils 2. When you want to plug the phone into a dock, we end up having to take entire case off as the case doesn't allow for fit, we ended up purchasing a cord that plugged into dock, then the other end plugged into phone. That worked fine but after all these years, you'd think they'd address this big problem. I wouldn't hesitate to buy more Otter Boxes in future. Also if you go on their website, you can build your own, play around with the colors etc. Be careful buying one on eBay, I did so and I'm certain it's not authentic as Otter Box told me they never sold that color before.

Nothing as you know is 100% protection for phones, but I can attest I've dropped my phone with the defender numerous times and it did not hurt it at all. I even dropped it in wet snow and it was fine. You should look on Otter Box website, they have test videos (at least they used to), In MY opinion the defender is the best protection.

You now have just the plastic cover that the I-phone is incased in. There is three tabs one on the top, and two on the side. This is crucial to not breaking the case, SLIGHTLY pry one of the side tabs away from the case with your finger nail. When the tab is clear seperate the case until it is clear of the first tab. Repeat this process for the other two tabs. And the plastic case should the come apart into two pieces. If this does not help search the problem on YouTube for a demonstrational video.

Occasionally it won't connect when you enter the car and press the 'button' (the entire front), but a quick unplug, or a search from the phone will correct that. I suspect this is a phone-side issue.

(Minnesota United States) - See all my reviews Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?) This review is from: HTC T8788 7 Surround Unlocked Phone with Windows 7, Surround Sound, 5MP Camera and HD Video - US Warranty - Black (Wireless Phone Accessory) I put in my T-mobile prepaid sim card and I was good to go. -----------------------------------------------------------------!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have a Zune Pass so I enjoy using its kickstand and listening to music. If you do not plan on listening listening to music for at least a couple hours a week through its speaker, I would suggest going with a thinner phone. The speaker is nice but does add bulk to the phone and after a couple weeks never really snaps shut - this is was why I gave it a 4 and not a 5. I also do not like the rocker volume button or camera button - they feel cheap. This is my first smart phone and I am not aware of the capabilities of Apple and Android. I am impressed with the integration between Hotmail and Skydrive. If you take a photo, you can set it to back up automatically to Skydrive. The camera is decent. I wish the camera button was more pronounced. Using the phone is not frustrating and apps pop up quickly."}

If you install a free launcher such as Launcher Pro from the Android Market, you can select a feature in the launcher configuration where you can "hide" Facebook, Twitter and other social media type programs. The programs are still on the phone, but not obvious to the normal user. Also, if you want to get rid of certain "links" in the web browser, you can "long press" the bookmark and select delete from the context menu. Finally, you might try installing an application called Webnanny in the Android Market to provide some level of content filtering in the browser.'}

So the easy answer to your question is NO UPGRADES NECESSARY. However, they just started throttling data once you go past 2.5gig. But it resets each monthly pay period. And that\'s a fair amount of data IMHO. Anyway, if you\'re considering this phone/plan then you must be looking for a rock-bottom price for a good (not great) service. It delivers. But if you want truly HUGE amounts of data and a cutting edge phone then you\'ll have to look elsewhere . . . and pay at least 3 times as much!'}

It has talk, text, web, MAPS, Navigation, messaging, camera, camcorder and other features. With MAPS you can see places all over the world from street view just as though you are in the middle of the street. You can see places like Amsterdam and see peoples houses, driveways, cars as though you are there. You select MAPS and type in where you want to see. Then you see an overview of that country from satellite view. Then wherever your finger touches you see that view from street view. It\'s amazing! You can see the inside the White House and see rooms and even see inside the Oval Office! With MAPS, you can \'travel\' all over the neighborhood going down the street as though you are there. You can send pictures as picture messages. Look on Google under Send pictures with Optimus V for instructions. You may have to pay to send pictures. To take pictures it\'s free. It has You Tube. Download PlayStore and Playstore services for more apparently. Get a 32 MB chip card from Amazon for more memory. The Optimus V really is a good phone. The screen is about 8" L by 6" high. Get spare batteries, a charger, and a lighter charger from Cellphone Shop. Get several individual battery chargers from Cellphone shop. It has Navigation with GPS but kinda don\'t trust it.'}

The screen protector has tiny ridges on the interior side of the screen protector, similiar to the matte type of screen protectors. The iPhones that are being sold today have an oleophobic coating on the glass screen to help resist fingerprint smudges. The downside of having an oleophobic coating is that if you buy a glossy type of screen protector that does not have ridges on on the interior side, then when you put that screen protector on an iPhone, you may see oil bubbles (or air bubbles) between the screen protector and the iPhone. There is a July 21, 2011 review that complained about the bubbles that covered the screen on an Otterbox case that he bought from one of Amazon's third-party merchants. I suspect that the case that he bought was a counterfeit Otterbox case. I do not have any bubbles with my Otterbox case, but I bought my case from Amazon instead buying one from one of Amazon's third-party merchants. In my opinion, many third-party merchants sell legitimate items, but I would be naive to believe that all third-party merchants sell legitimate products."}

(source: http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a=10794). The mouse and keyboard should work as they are just bluetooth devices. I am not sure if the ports (micro hdmi and micro usb) will align between this dock and the atrix HD. Even if they did (or you use lapdock extension cables like I do with my Droid 4) at best, it will allow for mirror mode, where the phone's display is mirrored onto the connected TV. The usb host on the dock should work (allowing the use of usb flash drives) but I do not know if the IR Remote will work, presumably the IR sends keyboard commands that the dock sends to the phone over USB. One thing I found out was that NETFLIX on android does not support the keyboard MEDIA keys (back forward pause play, etc)"}

The activation for this sim is done online from the Simple Mobile website. It will ask you to enter the sim card number, which is a long number located on the back of the card, and you will choose the pre-paid plan that you want. After that it will ask for your credit card info to pay for the plan. I believe it will also help you register for a Simple Mobile online account during the first-time activation process. You can either manually pay monthly, or enroll in automatic billing, which Simple Mobile calls "Auto Re-Up." If you choose to do it manually, you will need to "Re-Up" from the Simple Mobile website each month by signing in to your account and paying from there. They will send out text reminders when your pre-paid month is about to end so that you don\'t forget. The process is quite easy, and if you have any issues, don\'t hesitate to call their help line. I\'ve only had to call them a few times, but each time the customer service people were very helpful. As far as the Nokia phone goes, this sim should work if your phone has the correct sim card slot. There are 3 common sim card sizes: mini-SIM, micro-SIM, and nano-SIM. The nano-SIM is only found on iPhones, so you don\'t have to worry about that. Micro-SIM cards are used in many of the newer models of phones, particularly high-end phones like the Samsung Galaxy S series, etc. This Simple Mobile kit comes with a mini-SIM, which is actually the largest of the three, even though the name says "mini" in it. Your phone\'s manual should have the information you need regarding the sim card size that is required, and if you don\'t have it, you can also search for your phone model on websites such as GSMArena or PhoneArena. There are Simple Mobile starter kits available with micro-SIM cards, should you require that instead. Good luck!'}

As a work-around I stored my home phone listing as "Bat Cave." It worked flawlessly. You may have to raise you voice to get the TX500 to respond with the correct phone book listing. If the names in your phone list are complex, that will also drive you nuts because the phone may respond either by going back to sleep or it will respond with "Did you say.....(another name in your list)" and the reply is incorrect. One last thing I should mention is to keep the unit charged. A full charge in the TX500 will last two to four weeks or more depending on how often it\'s used. One more thing I need to throw in at this point is characteristics that\'s not too clear in the manual. If you turn on the unit when you enter the car, it will remain on until you leave the car.
